# manipulate-backend-lowdb

in this repo we show how you can use express to serve static files, as well as, how to implement an API to save and display data that is stored in a lowdb database.
we manipulate records in a lowdb database. The database contains records for a publication and has form data with an id, title, and whether or not that content was published. Content can be submitted to the form and all data can be displayed. also we implemented functionality to delete all records from the database.
